<h3>What is Free Dimmer?</h3>

<p>Free Dimmer will minimize the brigthness of your Android Phone or Android Tablet
once a day at a time which you configure.  Set this time to a time shortly after you
go to bed and if you then wake during the night and use your phone or tablet in the
dark the screen will not dazzle you.</p>

<p>It has been widely reported in the media that the blue light from tablets and phones
used in the evening can disrupt sleep patterns. This application may assist, but at the
current time this has not (to the best of my knowledge) been scientifically tested.</p>
