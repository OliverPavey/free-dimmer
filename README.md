# Free Dimmer

## Overview

Free Dimmer may be used to minimise the brightness of your android phone or tablet 
at a given time each day. It is intended that this time should be set to just after 
your normal bed time. In this way it is hoped that should you wake and use the device 
you will not experience unnecessary initial glare, until you are able to manually 
adjust the brightness.

Free Dimmer is a open-source ad-free uncharged app with no in-app purchasing.
